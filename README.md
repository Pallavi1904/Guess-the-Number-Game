# 🎯 Guess the Number Game (Python)

A fun and interactive command-line game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it!  
This project is great for beginners learning **Python**, covering topics like loops, conditionals, user input, and the `random` module.

## 📌 How the Game Works

- The program randomly picks a number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game tells the user whether their guess is:
  - Too high
  - Too low
  - Or correct!
- The number of attempts is tracked.
- The game ends once the user correctly guesses the number.
